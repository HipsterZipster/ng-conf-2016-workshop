* Powerful abstraction
* angular is javascript
* javascript is not angular

  ### Develop a Performance Attitude
  .attitude[![Performance Attitude](img/attitude.jpg)]
]

???
* cannot achieve by self.
* consider larger implication and scla.
* No over engineering.
* Development small data
* We need to think.
* developing attitude, you can fix them.

Let's take care of the first goal
---

## Simple Tricks 1: Always upgrade angular

.fullImage[![Angular 1.5.5/1.5.1 Changelog](img/changelog.png)]

???
* Angular hard work fast
* Document in change log
* example
* No idea, don't have too
* semver since 1.3
---

## Simple Tricks 2: Disable Debug Data

.fullImage[![Disable Debug Information](img/disable-debug.png)]

???
* Attaches scope info, css classes
* Tools SCOPE()!
* Disable using $compileProvider
* reloadWithDebugInfo
---

## Simple Tricks 3: Always use `track by`

.fullImage[![track by](img/track-by.png)]

???
* Most performance ng-repeat
* track by is one of these things
* avoid rebuilding DOM nodes 
* track by must be unique
* use $index

Remaining are wild Anti-examples
---

## Simple Tricks 4: Bundle JavaScript

.fullImage[![Too many JS files](img/many-js.png)]

???
* network tab
* 164 script tags, SERIALLY
* 16 sec 2MB.

* Concatenate before deploy

* TEMPLATE inlining or $templateCache
---

## Simple Tricks 5: Don't duplicate AJAX

.fullImage[![duplicate ajax](img/duplicate-ajax.png)]

???
* 11 requests in 300 milliseconds
* 2 different requests 5 times
* I woud never

* Easy if watch or `ng-repeat`.
* Fixes are pretty invasive

* memozie pending promises
* If a function returns a promise and the promise is still pending when the function is invoked a second time, retrun the original pending promise.
---

## Simple Tricks 6: Limit simultaneous AJAX

.fullImage[![many ajax](img/many-ajax.png)]

???
* 23 Ajax
* 6 Ajax per domain
* cant rewrite
---

## Simple Tricks 6 (Cont)

.fullImage[![aggregator](img/aggregator.png)]

???
* aggregator service
* accepts a list of GET requests
* cost of higher payload size
---

## Simple Tricks 7: Bocking the event loop

.fullImage[![Watchers](img/watchers.png)]

???
* Single threaded
* click click
* too many watchers, to complex

* 100 seconds
* No acceptable even with dial-up
---

.fullImage[![That's all](img/thats-all.gif)]

???
* You may feel like this.
* Just the low-cost
* We have more.

Questions?
---

.fullImage[![Blind](img/blind.gif)]

???
* Long jump blind
* Measure improvement from a users perpsective
* Best baseline.
* manual doesn't cut it.
* 1 measurement, 1 machine, 1 point in time

* significant impact on users.
* Anaytics tool
* Take gmail
---

.fullImage[![Gmail](img/gmail.png)]

???
* Take gmail
* confident when user can interact
* Let's assume you have a really good one and it works.
* What about route changes?
---

.fullImage[![Gmail Stars](img/gmail-starred.png)]

???
* click link
* route, controller, ajax
---

.fullImage[![Gmail Stars](img/gmail-loading.png)]

???
* see loading
* anaytics "done" loading?
* think solution
---

.fullImage[![Timeline](img/stabilize.png)]

???
* profile complex
* Horizontal Axis is time
* Vertical Axis is depth of function calls
* When is app done loading?
---

.fullImage[![Timeline Stabilization](img/stabilize-point.png)]

???
* everything that happens
* Digests: watcher
* AJAX: $httpInterceptros
* DOM Mutations: DOM Mutation Observers/DOM Mutation Events
---

# Route Stabilization

---

.fullImage[![Timeline Stabilization](img/stabilization-graph.png)]

???
* Amazing things
* top 8 pages
* week in november
* veritcal axis is time 
* Slowest, variation, statistics
* Make decisions and where to spend time.
---

.fullImage[![Performance Regression](img/perf-regression.png)]

???
* detect regressions
* somewhere in the middle
* Allows us to see impact on real users, in near real time.
* This was an extra ajax request.
